 * 2. filePatternRegularExp: Files names matching given regex will be read<br/>
 * 3. scanIntervalMillis: interval between two scans to discover new files in input directory<br/>
 * 4. recursive: if scan recursively input directories<br/>
 * 5. blockSize: block size used to read input blocks of file<br/>
 * 6. readersCount: count of readers to read input file<br/>
 * 7. sequencialFileRead: If emit file blocks in sequence?
